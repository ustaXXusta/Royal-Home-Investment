# Royal Home Investment - Freelance Project (Unfinished)
https://ustaxxusta.github.io/Royal-Home-Investment/
This project is a real estate company landing page created for **Royal Home Investment**. The freelance job involved designing and developing a clean, modern interface to showcase their property listings and services.

Due to client decisions, the project was left unfinished and is not deployed. The current work includes the basic structure and initial styling but lacks full functionality and content completion.

The landing page aimed to:
- Present company branding clearly
- Highlight featured properties
- Provide easy navigation for potential clients

This repository serves as a partial deliverable and a demonstration of the initial development phase.
